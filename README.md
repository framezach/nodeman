Hello! The game is functional as of 4/13/2018. Simply using node hangman.js will start the game. 
Each round will prompt you with a checkbox. Pro tip: To select an option from the checkbox
you must press the space key, then press enter. From here you can choose to start the game or 
call it quits. The choice is yours, and yours alone.
